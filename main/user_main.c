/**         
 * TEST CODE BRIEF
 *
 * This example will show you how to use the SHT30 via I2C:
 *
 * - read external i2c SHT30 sensor
 * - TODO: Use one I2C port(master mode) to configure different modes of the SHT30
 *
 * Pin assignment via menuconfig, defaults are:
 *
 * - master:
 *    GPIO4 (probably D1) is assigned as the data signal of i2c master port
 *    GPIO5 (probably D2) is assigned as the clock signal of i2c master port
 *
 * Connection:
 *
 * - connect sda/scl of sensor with GPIO5/GPIO4
 * - no need to add external pull-up resistors, driver will enable internal pull-up resistors.
 *
 * Test items:
 *
 * - read the sensor data, if connected.
